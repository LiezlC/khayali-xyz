# 🤖 WisdomAgent Architect

**WisdomAgent Architect** is a custom AI assistant built to support the design and development of multi-agent systems focused on structured knowledge extraction and analysis. Originally designed to power the *Wisdom Syndicate* framework, this agent helps bridge unstructured documents and structured project memory — with a particular focus on extractives, infrastructure, and social-environmental governance.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

- Modular Python agent design (`asyncio`, `dataclasses`, `enum`)
- Named Entity Recognition, keyword extraction, relation/event detection using `spaCy`
- Mapping unstructured inputs into structured schemas like `ProjectContext` and `IssueRecord`
- Cross-agent schema integration and structured memory
- GPT-interoperable; works well with Claude, Gemini, and other model collaborators

## ⚙️ Ideal For

- Developers building custom knowledge agents
- Analysts working with project data in complex sectors
- Research teams automating structured learning from semi-structured sources

## 🚀 Get Started

To use this assistant:
1. Clone the repository or load the agent context via Hugging Face’s Chat SDK
2. Import or define the schema objects used in the *Wisdom Syndicate* architecture
3. Initialize `WisdomAgent Architect` with access to your pipeline tools
4. Interact via chat or API to co-develop structured extraction routines
