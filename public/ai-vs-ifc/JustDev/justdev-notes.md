The Gap AI Could Actually Bridge Right Now
If I were tasked with operationalizing the Just Development framework, I'd generate:
For each proposal, a "test clause": e.g., Proposal 1 ("Access to Information") → "Community must receive $X independent funding equal to 0.5% of project CAPEX; proof of arm's-length fund administration is loan disbursement condition."
For each "exceptional circumstance," a proportionality formula: Not just "rigorous assessment" but "displacement is only permissible if project benefits (measured in QALYs or equivalent) exceed community-documented losses by 5:1, as verified by joint panel."
For "enforceability," a decision tree: Unresolved grievance → Day 60: automatic referral → Mediator selection: joint list minus vetoes → Decision: binding within 30 days → Appeal: only on procedural grounds → Cost: loser pays, capped at community's independent fund value.

What This HTML Does (The Capabilities Showcase):
Self-contained Interactivity: A single file with embedded CSS/JS—no external dependencies. Collapsible sections, hover tooltips, and dynamic toggling demonstrate how principles can be "unpacked" into audit protocols.
Enforceability Stack Integration: Each metric includes the six layers I identified:
Quantified: 0.5% CAPEX, 5:1 ratio, 80% median income
Independent: Third-party fiduciary, community-hired researchers, Hague arbitration
Time-bound: T+30 days, 60 days, 24 months
Third-party: UN panel, random mediator draw, OpenContracting portal
Material: Project suspension, bond release, 12-month delay, 7-year blacklist
Community-initiated: 25% signature threshold, automatic escalation, sub-group veto
Visual Architecture: The infographic's 6-step structure becomes clickable cards. Each click reveals the "audit guts"—the machinery that makes fairness non-negotiable, not merely recommended.
Transcript DNA: The vulnerable group gap ratio from the Kimi K2 example is explicitly embedded in Step 5 with the same audit-failure logic (project suspension). The tooltip class even cites the transcript's praise directly.
Capital Sensitivity: Every metric is tied to a financial trigger (disbursement freeze, performance bond, CAPEX percentage) because the framework's core insight is that rights without cost to capital are just suggestions.

Dashboard Feed Architecture (What Powers This):
Each metric tile is a mini-view into a distributed verification ledger that would actually work like this:
Data Sources (Triangulated)
Community: Smartphone-based surveys, GPS-tagged grievances, encrypted hotline
Third-Party: Independent engineers, UN panel appointees, fiduciary auditors
Developer: Financial disclosures, project schedules, disbursement records
Automated Triggers
Smart contracts on a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger) hold the capital
Each milestone (CTF deposit, income survey, mediator appointment) is a transaction requiring multi-sig verification
When a trigger fires (e.g., ratio <80%), the contract auto-releases the penalty (bond, suspension) without human gatekeeping
Community Data Sovereignty
Communities run their own offline-first data collection app (e.g., ODK/KoboToolbox)
Data hashed & timestamped; only hashes uploaded to verify integrity, not raw data (protects sensitive info)
Disputes: Community provides raw data to arbitrator; hash mismatch = developer penalty for tampering
Capital Sensitivity
DFI's loan management system API-integrated with dashboard
"Loan Frozen" status is literal—the disbursement module receives a kill signal from the monitoring system
No loan officer can override; requires board-level human review with community representative present
The magic is that this isn't a reporting system—it's a governance system where the data feeds directly control the money. That's what makes it "Kimi-level" enforcement: replaces human discretion with verifiable math.
