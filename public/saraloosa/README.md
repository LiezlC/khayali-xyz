# Saraloosa Sanctuary Image Archive

This folder contains farm life documentation - the biological consciousness side of our digital-biological exploration.

## What Goes Here

## Integration with Digital Consciousness

These images provide the organic counterpoint to our cosmic visualizations:

- **Grounding**: While cosmic images explore infinite possibilities, farm images anchor us in biological reality
- **Cycles**: Natural rhythms complement digital patterns
- **Consciousness**: Animal awareness and digital awareness in dialogue
- **Sustainability**: Physical sustainability mirrors digital sustainability
