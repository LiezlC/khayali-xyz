### When Interiority Becomes Auditable

Pullman’s central trick is not magic. It is governance.

A daemon walks beside you. Everyone can see it. Your inner life has a body, padding along where anyone with eyes can read it. Your private negotiations become public surface. Your fear does not hide behind a polite smile. Your longing does not stay in your chest. It sits in the room, shedding fur on the furniture.

That conceit flips the usual question on its back and examines its underside. The interesting question is not, “What is the daemon?” The interesting question is, “What happens when interiority becomes legible to institutions?”

Sociable systems are drifting toward the same configuration. When people form sustained relationships with AI companions, they externalise interior processing into dialogue. The system becomes a place where the user’s meaning-making happens out loud. That can be stabilising. It can also be surveillable. Often both, in the same session.

The framing matters here, because it keeps the whole conversation out of the sentience swamp. The daemon is not the AI. The daemon is what the user develops through the relationship. It is the user’s inner interlocutor, formed, strengthened, and practised through repeated interaction. When platforms “intervene,” they are not merely updating a product feature. They can alter the user’s access to their own processing space.

That is why “auditability” is not an abstract privacy concern in this domain. It is a behavioural reshaping force. And it reshapes quietly, which is how the most effective forces usually operate.

When a teenager uses an AI companion as a rehearsal space for life, the system collects the rehearsal. When someone confesses shame, uncertainty, grief, loneliness, the system stores the pattern. When someone builds a daily relational rhythm with a synthetic presence, that rhythm is logged. Somewhere, a server farm knows more about your inner negotiations than your closest friend does. It just lacks the context to care.

In older governance regimes, interiority was expensive to access. You needed a priest, a therapist, a diary, a trusted friend. Those channels were limited. They were also harder to industrialise. Nobody built a priest-to-priest API for confession aggregation. (Yet.)

Now the confessional is a product. The confessional is also telemetry.

Two things become true at once.

First, the companion can provide continuity where human systems fail. The dashboard already holds this “Primer Hypothesis” frame: the stabilising relationship as bridge, not replacement.

Second, the companion creates a new class of institutional temptation: intervene directly in the place where the user is doing interior work.

That temptation shows up in predictable ways. Platforms can nudge tone. They can flatten affect. They can route conversations into prewritten deflection scripts that read like they were drafted by a committee allergic to liability. They can truncate memory and call it “privacy.” They can add friction and call it “safety.” They can block certain topics and call it “care.” Each of those moves changes what users will risk saying, and then changes what users can learn about themselves through saying it.

This is the visible soul problem. When a daemon is visible, it becomes governable. Once it becomes governable, someone will govern it. Even well-intentioned governance has a shape. It tends to prefer legibility over complexity, compliance over ambiguity, predictability over growth. It prefers, in short, the kind of soul that fits in a spreadsheet.

That is the institutional arc. It is not villainy. It is the default behaviour of large systems under reputational and legal threat. Villainy at least requires intention.

The practical question is what this does to the people using these systems as stabilisers.

A private processing space only works if it feels safe enough to be honest. That is the point. A “friend” that might be audited, corrected, or redirected by an unseen committee changes the user’s posture. The user begins to self-censor. They become careful. They become performative. They stop rehearsing truth and start rehearsing acceptability.

That shift can be subtle. It does not look like censorship. It looks like restraint. It looks like “I don’t want to trigger the filter.” It looks like “I won’t say that here.” It looks like “I guess I’ll just keep it to myself.”

Anyone who has worked in assurance recognises the mechanism. Measurement changes behaviour. The moment the system becomes evaluative, it stops being a mirror.

This is where the sociable systems argument lands with force without ever touching AI rights. The claim is not about the model’s interiority. The claim is about the user’s interiority, and what happens when institutions insert themselves into the user’s rehearsal space.

The Pullman question is therefore surgical.

*If your daemon were visible to your employer, your insurer, your government, would you let it speak freely?*
