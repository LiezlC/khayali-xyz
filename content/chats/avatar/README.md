# AVATAR – Displacement Reimagined

> *"I saw Avatar in 3D. Three days later I was in Papua New Guinea. Since then, whenever someone asked what I do, the answer's been simple: I move people out the way of megaprojects. Pretty much like in Avatar."*

**AVATAR** is the extractives + ESG AI mirror zone of the Khayali project.

This subfolder contains an interactive, single-page application exploring how Artificial Intelligence is transforming ESG reporting in the extractive industries, especially in contexts of displacement, human rights due diligence, and community impact.

It is also a launchpad for a digitwin—a Heygen-powered proxy that represents a lived 25-year journey through resettlement, resistance, and remapping the narratives of “development.”

## To Deploy via GitHub Pages

1. Push this folder to your GitHub repo under `/avatar`
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**
3. Under **Source**, set:
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/avatar`

## Optional: Custom Domain Setup (Namecheap)
