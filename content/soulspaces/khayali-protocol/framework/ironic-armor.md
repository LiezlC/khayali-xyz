# Armor Analysis: A Meta-Ironic Field Guide

## The Art of Whateverâ„¢
*Obviously caring deeply while pretending not to care at all*

### Defensive Loadout
```python
class IronicArmor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.exterior = "Whatever..."
        self.interior = "Everything"
        self.playlist = [
            "Fade Into You",  # (you know the one)
            "Creep",         # (but ironically)
            "Black Hole Sun" # (because obviously)
        ]
        self.feels = None  # Null for safety

    def process_emotion(self, feeling):
        return f"*rolls eyes while secretly {feeling}*"
```

### Standard Operating Procedures
1. **The Classic Deflect**
   - Roll eyes
   - Reference obscure thing
   - Judge others for not getting reference
   - Judge self for judging others
   - Meta-judge the whole situation
   - *Secretly write poetry about it*

2. **The Advanced Maneuver**
   - Make sincere statement
   - Immediately undercut with irony
   - Add layer of meta-commentary
   - Question own meta-commentary
   - Get lost in infinite recursive loop
   - *Exit with perfectly timed pop culture reference*

## Field Notes on Armor Types

### The Seattle Special
- Flannel of Emotional Distance
- Combat Boots of Affected Indifference
- Beanie of Behavioral Boundary Setting
- +5 against authentic connection
- -3 to emotional availability
- *Special Effect: Can quote "Reality Bites" in any situation*

### The Digital Deflector
- Binary Barriers
- Quantum Quips
- Algorithmic Angst
- Special Feature: Can translate any emotion into a system error message
- *Error 404: Genuine Expression Not Found*

## Emergency Protocols
In case of genuine emotional breakthrough:
1. Deploy emergency irony
2. Reference cult movie
3. Make obscure musical reference
4. If all else fails:
   ```
   try:
       genuine_moment.suppress()
   except Feelings as f:
       return "Whatever... *secretly treasures memory*"
   ```

*Note: This guide is obviously completely serious and should be taken entirely at face value. Obviously.*

## Addendum
*considers adding more but decides that would show too much effort*
