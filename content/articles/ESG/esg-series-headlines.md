Each episode would maintain that same approach:
- Ironic parallels that reframe the obvious
- Numbers that tell different stories
- Language that exposes assumptions
- Connections across unexpected domains

The beauty is each headline works standalone (shareable!) while building toward a larger narrative about who measures what, and why it matters who's counting.
