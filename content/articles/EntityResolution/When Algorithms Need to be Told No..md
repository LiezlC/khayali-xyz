## When Algorithms Need to be Told: No.

*(Or: What Happens When a Community Raises an Eyebrow and Says, "Actually, that’s not us.")*

Transparency without agency? Just surveillance with nicer fonts.

Entity resolution — that charming little backend trick where databases decide Person A is the same as Person B across five systems — is both bureaucratic sorcery and bureaucratic menace. It helps hospitals find your lost records. It also helps mining companies link your grandmother’s fishing camp to a spreadsheet that says: "Available for extraction." (Kukutai & Taylor, 2016)

Enter: the **community veto**.

Not a suggestion box. Not a complaint hotline. A structural right to say: "You got that link wrong. Delete it."

### Algorithm, Meet Auntie

In Canada, Indigenous communities have started saying no. Not softly. Not politely. But with protocols. Your algorithm says this summer camp is a permanent settlement? We say it’s not. You linked our elders' decisions to land titles? Wrong model. (Walter, 2021)

These aren’t complaints. They’re corrections. Like editing a bad Wikipedia page about your own family, but the stakes are land, memory, and law.

Other groups are catching on:
- Environmental justice advocates pushing back on models that ignore legacy pollution (Mohai, Pellow & Roberts, 2009)
- Labor organizers saying: we work collectively, so stop slicing us into individual productivity widgets (Woodcock & Graham, 2020)

Pattern: when communities can say *no*, systems start getting more honest.

### The Boring Bits That Matter (aka: Technical Implementation)

Let’s talk plumbing:

- **Provenance Tracking**: Don’t just say "these match" — say how, when, and with what confidence. Algorithms need footnotes. (Borgman, 2015)

- **Challenge Mechanisms**: Buttons. Forms. Human beings. Some way to say, "That’s not me. That’s not us. That’s not true."

- **Consent Hierarchies**: Not all data is equal. Public records? Maybe a heads-up. Social media? Ask me. Traditional knowledge? Ask *all of us*. (Carroll, Rodríguez-Lonebear & Martinez, 2019)

- **Temporal Boundaries**: People change. Communities evolve. A teenage tweet is not a governance mandate. Set expiry dates. Or at least reminders.

This isn’t about stopping entity resolution. It’s about putting it on a leash, with a community holding the handle.

### Scenes From the Field: When Veto Power Works

- **Māori Data Sovereignty**: You want to use iwi data? You ask iwi. Period. Not just individual consent. Collective. Cultural. Context-aware. (Te Mana Raraunga, 2018)

- **Detroit’s Community Benefits Ordinance**: Before big projects get permits, they negotiate with residents. Increasingly, this includes how their data will be analyzed. Demographics, displacement risk, property value impacts? Communities can say "Nope, not how we see it." (City of Detroit, n.d.)

- **Community Data Audits**: When an algorithm says "denied services due to risk," community groups have demanded audits — legal + technical. They become co-authors, not data subjects. (Carroll et al., 2019)

Entity resolution is the ghostwriter of modern policy. It whispers suggestions into systems that feel neutral, scientific, inevitable. But if the community being described can veto the script, the story changes.

And sometimes, that story begins with:

"Nice try, algorithm. But no."
