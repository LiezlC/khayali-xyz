## Algorithmic Redlining: How Entity Resolution Perpetuates Housing Discrimination

*(Or: The Quiet Return of Old Patterns in Shiny Digital Clothes)*

Housing discrimination via entity resolution is not a dystopian sketch of the future. It’s here, embedded in rental platforms, mortgage underwriting tools, and neighborhood scoring dashboards. The cruelty is subtle: people don’t receive a letter stamped “Denied due to race.” Instead, an algorithm trained on linked data decides someone is too risky, too unstable, too expensive — all while claiming neutrality.

### Rental Market Surveillance

Property management systems now do more than check your credit. They ingest entire digital biographies: rental applications, employment histories, criminal records, even scraps from social media. Through entity resolution, these fragments fuse into a comprehensive “tenant risk profile.” (Angwin & Parris Jr., 2016)

The effect? Landlords can exclude en masse without acknowledging bias. A criminal record decades old, a credit blip during a pandemic, or an algorithmic inference about your social circle can trigger automated rejection. Research has shown these systems disproportionately reject Black and Latino renters, especially those tied to certain zip codes. (Richardson et al., 2019)

### Mortgage Lending Algorithms

Redlining once involved literal maps with red boundaries around Black neighborhoods. Now, it’s spreadsheets and models. Mortgage algorithms feed on data sources ranging from credit histories and shopping habits to geolocation pings and even network associations. Entity resolution enables lenders to collapse all this into a “creditworthiness score” that often mirrors historical segregation.

Investigations by journalists and academics show that algorithmic scoring systems continue to deny loans or inflate interest rates for applicants in historically marginalized communities, despite ostensibly race-neutral criteria. (Bartlett et al., 2019)

### Neighborhood Profiling

Real estate platforms sell not just houses but entire imaginaries of “good” neighborhoods. Their algorithms classify blocks into tiers of investment potential. Predictive models link crime statistics, school ratings, consumer spending, and census data. Entity resolution transforms these signals into neighborhood scores that guide advertising, property valuations, and mortgage marketing.

The outcome is familiar: affluent (often white) neighborhoods receive targeted promotions, while poorer, more diverse communities are sidelined as “high risk” zones. Studies show that algorithmic neighborhood rankings reinforce racial segregation patterns, subtly steering resources away from already marginalized areas. (O’Neil, 2016)

### The Insurance Connection

Insurance underwriting is another arena where entity resolution perpetuates structural inequities. Premiums don’t just reflect a property’s condition. They’re shaped by connected datasets: crime stats, local consumer behavior, property records, and even the online activities of residents. Algorithms stitch these together into “risk categories.”

The result: households in minority neighborhoods often face higher premiums, pricing out already vulnerable populations from stable home ownership. (Pinto, 2018)

### Enforcement Challenges

Fair housing law was designed to combat overt discrimination: explicit refusals, biased advertisements, redlined maps. Algorithms operate differently. They rarely mention race, gender, or family status outright. Instead, they rely on proxies — zip codes, consumer preferences, criminal justice data — that correlate tightly with protected characteristics.

This plausible deniability makes enforcement difficult. Regulators struggle to prove intent when algorithms use “neutral” variables that consistently disadvantage protected groups. The HUD’s 2019 charges against Facebook for discriminatory housing ads highlighted this challenge: the platform allowed advertisers to micro-target audiences by race proxies like interests and location, effectively excluding entire populations while claiming neutrality. (HUD v. Facebook, 2019)

### Toward Accountability

Despite the opacity, cracks of accountability are emerging:

- **Algorithmic Audits**: Independent reviews of housing algorithms can reveal disparate impacts. Some jurisdictions are considering requirements for bias audits before algorithmic systems are deployed. (Raji & Buolamwini, 2019)
- **Community Advocacy**: Tenant unions, digital rights groups, and housing activists are building campaigns against discriminatory tech practices, reframing algorithmic bias as a civil rights issue.
- **Legal Frameworks**: Scholars argue for updating fair housing law to address algorithmic proxies, extending liability to cover discriminatory outcomes even when intent is obscured by automation. (Selbst & Barocas, 2018)

Entity resolution is a technical marvel. But in housing, it often serves as a sorting machine that quietly encodes old inequities into new systems. The promise of data-driven fairness collapses when linked datasets inherit historical injustice.

The ghost of redlining isn’t gone. It just has better software.
