## When Algorithms Track Solidarity

*(Or: How Entity Resolution Became the Boss's Best Friend)*

A warehouse worker posts a blurry photo of broken safety gear. A delivery driver vents in a WhatsApp group about unpredictable shifts. A retail clerk shares a meme about unionizing. These aren't isolated actions. They're signals. And increasingly, they're being noticed.

Not by managers peering over shoulders, but by **entity resolution algorithms** quietly humming behind dashboards, connecting digital crumbs into patterns of organizing.

### The Rise of Algorithmic Oversight

Entity resolution — the process of matching data fragments across systems to construct unified profiles — has found its way into workforce management. Originally used for fraud detection and marketing, it's now doing a new kind of detection: **collective action**.

These systems pull from everywhere: Slack threads, GPS logs, biometric scans, calendar invites, social media posts. They don't just track behavior. They interpret it. A flurry of encrypted messages among drivers? A spike in synchronized breaks? Posts about safety conditions from multiple employees? Flagged, analyzed, escalated.

Amazon's operations are the archetype. Their systems monitor private messaging, break overlaps, productivity dips, and even bathroom coordination — all stitched together by entity resolution models that surface "risk signals." Alerts go to management with recommended responses. (Lecher, 2019; Kantor, Weise & Ashford, 2021)

Retail giants like Walmart and Target aren't far behind. Their platforms combine scheduling data, internal comms, and point-of-sale behavior to map informal networks and identify coordination clusters. (Levin, 2018; The Guardian, 2022)

In the gig economy, platforms like Uber and DoorDash track app usage, driver co-location, and posting behavior to preempt protests before they happen. (Rosenblat, 2018; Dubal, 2017)

### The Tech Stack of Surveillance

These aren't just big databases. They're layered systems built for prediction:

- **Data Collection Layers**: Monitoring tools gather everything from keystrokes to social graphs.
- **Entity Resolution Engines**: Match and merge records across systems, turning fragments into full identities.
- **Pattern Recognition Models**: Trained on past organizing behavior to detect new versions in real time.
- **Risk Analytics**: Score employees on their likelihood of organizing. Trigger actions.
- **Response Integration**: HR systems act: shift changes, exclusion from gigs, or algorithmic de-prioritization. (Ajunwa, Crawford & Schultz, 2017)

It isn't just about seeing what workers do. It's about predicting what they might do. And then nudging, stalling, or silencing.

### Surveillance Without Employment

Gig workers live in a paradox: not employees, but surveilled as if they were. Lacking union protections, they remain algorithmically dependent. Missed a shift after attending a protest? That could cost you visibility. Joined an activist WhatsApp group? Expect your rating to mysteriously drop. (Dubal, 2017; Rahman & Thelen, 2019)

### Resistance: Jamming the Machine

Workers are adapting:

- **Secure Comms**: Encrypted platforms, burner accounts, anonymity protocols.
- **Distributed Leadership**: No central organizers to track.
- **Noise Flooding**: Deliberately creating confusing patterns to overwhelm surveillance.
- **Legal Friction**: Challenges under privacy and labor laws. (Tarnoff, 2022; Pasquale, 2015)

Still, the systems evolve faster than regulation. The question becomes: not just how to resist, but how to redesign.

### Toward Watchable Algorithms

We need:
- **Transparency Laws**: Know when and how you're being monitored.
- **Audit Mechanisms**: Independent reviews of how entity resolution is used.
- **Data Rights for Workers**: Access and challenge algorithmic profiles.
- **Organizing-Safe Zones**: Protected digital spaces for labor solidarity. (Zuboff, 2019; Adams & Deakin, 2014)

Entity resolution doesn’t have to be extractive. In different hands, it could surface unsafe conditions or amplify collective care. But right now, it mostly serves control.

And when algorithms watch the workers, who watches the algorithms?
