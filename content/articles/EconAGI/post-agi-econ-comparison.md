# Comparative Analysis: 20 AI Models on Post-AGI Economic Theory

## 1. Areas of Strong Consensus

### Core Economic Transformations
**Nearly Universal Agreement (18-20 models):**

- **Scarcity Redefinition**: All models agree that material scarcity will largely disappear for basic goods, but new scarcities will emerge:
  - Human attention (mentioned by 19/20 models)
  - Authentic experiences and human connection (20/20)
  - Computational resources/energy (18/20)
  - Data rights and high-quality datasets (15/20)
  - Unique physical locations (17/20)

- **Labor Obsolescence**: Complete agreement that human labor will lose traditional economic value
  - Cognitive and physical tasks automated (20/20)
  - Need for new social contracts beyond wage-based systems (19/20)
  - Shift from "doing" to "directing, experiencing, connecting" (18/20)

- **Money System Evolution**: Strong consensus on digital transformation
  - Physical currency becoming obsolete (19/20)
  - Emergence of specialized tokens/currencies (17/20)
  - Programmable money with embedded rules (16/20)

### Emerging Economic Concepts
**Broad Agreement (15-18 models):**

- **Post-Scarcity Economics**: Shift from resource allocation to "meaning allocation" or "experience curation"
- **New Stores of Value**: Access rights, governance tokens, reputation, authentic human creations
- **Reciprocity Evolution**: From transactional to relational, with AGI mediating new forms of exchange
- **Universal Basic Income**: Necessity for wealth redistribution (mentioned by 16/20)

## 2. Notable Differences and Unique Perspectives

3. **Claude 4 Opus**:
   - "Intelligence Economy" concept
   - "Robo Economicus" replacing Homo Economicus
   - AGI Economic Trilemma (unique formulation)

4. **Claude 4 Sonnet**:

   - Demurrage and congestion pricing focus

7. **Grok 4**:
   - Game-theoretic "Prisoner's Dilemma amplified"
   - "Memory economies" concept
   - Bitcoin-AI synergy emphasis

8. **Julius.ai**:
   - Most granular technical specifications
   - Machine-to-machine payment systems
   - "Two-tier markets" (AGI-commodity vs human-premium)

9. **Manus**:
   - Most balanced academic treatment
   - Emphasis on "energy-based economy"
   - Detailed citations and evidence

10. **Perplexity**:
    - Most concise summary approach
    - Table format for clarity
    - Focus on psychological transition challenges

### Divergent Predictions

**Timeline Disagreements:**
- Aggressive: Some suggest AGI by late 2020s (Grok, GPT-5 citations)
- Conservative: Others imply decades-long transition (Manus, MythoMax)

**Governance Approaches:**
- **Centralized**: CBDCs and state control (Mistral, Pi.inc)
- **Decentralized**: DAOs and blockchain (Grok, GLM-4.5)
- **Hybrid**: Mixed systems (Julius, Claude models)

**Human Role Post-AGI:**
- **Optimistic**: Humans as creative directors and meaning-makers (Qwen, Emily)
- **Pessimistic**: Risk of complete economic irrelevance (Claude, Gemini)
- **Pragmatic**: Specific new roles identified (Julius, GLM-4.5)

### Unique Analytical Frameworks

1. **Formal Economic Models**:
   - Julius and GLM-4.5: Mathematical/technical approach
   - Gemini and Claude: Philosophical/theoretical
   - GPT-5: Historical/empirical

2. **Cultural Perspectives**:
   - Western-centric: Most models
   - Global consideration: Gemini, Manus
   - Local/community focus: Copilot, Emily 2.00

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - High concern: Claude models, Gemini
   - Moderate: Most others
   - Solution-focused: Julius, GLM-4.5

## 3. Surprising Gaps and Omissions

**Topics Under-Explored:**
- Environmental/climate implications (only 5/20 discuss)
- Geopolitical competition beyond US-China (limited coverage)
- Cultural/religious responses to AGI economics
- Transitional period mechanics (most jump to end-state)

## 4. Methodological Observations

**Response Styles:**
- **Academic**: GPT-5, Gemini, Manus (with citations)
- **Technical**: Julius, GLM-4.5 (with specifications)
- **Philosophical**: Claude models, Qwen
- **Practical**: Perplexity, Pi.inc, Copilot
- **Creative**: Grok, MythoMax, Pixtral

**Interesting Pattern**: The more recent/advanced models (Claude 4, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5) tend toward either highly technical or highly philosophical approaches, while mid-tier models often provide more balanced, practical summaries.

## Conclusion

While there's remarkable consensus on the fundamental disruption AGI will cause to economic theory, the models diverge significantly in their emphasis, tone, and specific predictions. The agreement on core transformations (scarcity shift, labor obsolescence, monetary evolution) is nearly universal, but the paths to get there, the governance structures needed, and the ultimate human role show considerable variation. This diversity of perspectives itself may be valuable for understanding the full range of possibilities in a post-AGI economic landscape.
