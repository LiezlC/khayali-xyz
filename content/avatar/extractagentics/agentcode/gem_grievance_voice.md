Yes, absolutely! Let's implement the Community Voice Agent.

Please confirm the following details for the Community Voice Agent so I can tailor the implementation:

Specific Input Modalities: While I will include multi-modal input (text, voice, images), are there any specific preferences for how these inputs are received (e.g., direct API upload for text, file paths for audio/images)?

Language Support: Are there any specific local languages beyond English that require priority for speech-to-text and translation?

Classification Categories: Do you have a preliminary set of grievance categories (e.g., "Environmental Damage," "Land Dispute," "Labor Issue," "Community Health," "Other")? This will help in defining the classification model.

Offline Storage Requirements: Are there any specific considerations for local storage beyond basic SQLite (e.g., data encryption at rest on the edge device)?

Notification Channels: Besides real-time dashboard updates, are SMS and email notifications sufficient, or are there other channels like push notifications to a mobile app or integration with a specific communication platform?

Dashboard Integration: What kind of data points or summaries would be most valuable to display on the real-time dashboard for grievances?

Once I have these details, I will provide the complete, production-ready code with testing, documentation, and deployment guidance.






Thanks this is a great start to identify more finetuning required. How would I go about designing a UI with ideally mostl;y tickbox selection options to get these requirement questions answered?

Excellent question! Designing a UI with mostly tickbox selections for these requirements will make the input process much more efficient and user-friendly. I'll outline a structure using a web-based UI approach, as it's highly flexible and accessible.

Here's how you can design a UI with tickbox selections for the Community Voice Agent requirements, along with some considerations for each section:

Community Voice Agent Configuration UI Design
The goal is to provide clear, concise options, leveraging tickboxes, radio buttons, and minimal text input where absolute necessary (e.g., for custom categories).

Section 1: Core Functionality & Input Modalities

[ ] Geographic Distribution of Grievances (Map View)

[ ] Trend Analysis (Grievances over Time)

[ ] Community Feedback / Satisfaction Score (if applicable)

4.3. Reporting Frequency: (Radio Buttons - Single select)

( ) Daily Summary Report

( ) Weekly Summary Report

( ) Monthly Summary Report

( ) On-demand Reporting

Section 5: Performance & Scalability
Title: System Performance Expectations

Description: Set general performance and resource utilization targets.

5.1. Expected Grievance Volume (per day): (Radio Buttons - Single select)

( ) Low (1-10)

( ) Medium (11-100)

( ) High (101-1000)

( ) Very High (1000+)

5.2. Response Time for Grievance Submission: (Radio Buttons - Single select)

( ) Instant (< 1 second)

[ ] World Bank Environmental and Social Framework (ESS)

[ ] Local Regulatory Requirements (e.g., South African specific)

[ ] GDPR / POPIA (for personal data protection)

[ ] Other (Please Specify): [Text Input Field]

UI Implementation Notes:
Front-end Framework: This can be built using any modern front-end framework like React, Vue, Angular, or even a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript setup.

Form Submission: The UI would gather all selected options and text inputs into a JSON object (or similar data structure) when a "Generate Agent" or "Configure" button is clicked.

Dynamic Fields: The "Other (Please Specify)" text fields should only appear if the corresponding "Other" tickbox is selected.

Tooltips/Help Text: Provide small info icons with tooltips next to complex options to explain what they mean (e.g., "What is Differential Sync?").

Validation: Implement client-side validation (e.g., ensure custom categories are not empty if checked).

By presenting these questions in a structured UI with tickboxes, you streamline the requirements gathering process significantly, leading to a much faster and more accurate agent implementation.

Once you fill in these options, I can proceed with the code generation!






Thanks, still kindof getting my head around how all this works. Can you please confirm what would be the output of the core you would generate once all the questons above have been answered?

You're asking a very important question to understand the process!

Once all the requirement questions (the "tickbox selection options" from the UI design) for the Community Voice Agent have been answered, the output I would generate would be a comprehensive and ready-to-use package for that specific agent.

Specifically, the "core" output would consist of:

Agent Overview
A concise description of the Community Voice Agent's purpose, its primary functionalities, and how it fits into the broader multi-agent system (e.g., its interactions with a Grievance Management Agent or a Notification Agent).

Complete Python Code Implementation
CommunityVoiceAgent Class: The full Python class inheriting from ExtractiveAgent, with all its methods implemented based on your selections. This will include:

Input Handling: Code to receive and parse multi-modal inputs (text, audio, image/video).

Language Processing: Integration for speech-to-text (for audio), language detection, and translation services.

Grievance Classification: Logic to categorize grievances based on the standard and custom categories you define.

Urgency Assessment: Implementation for determining the urgency level of a grievance.

Routing Logic: Code to route processed grievances to appropriate internal teams or other agents.

Data Management: Integration with a local SQLite database for offline storage, including data encryption if selected, and mechanisms for data synchronization.

Communication Handlers: Methods to send and receive messages to and from other agents in the system using the defined protocols.

Error Handling & Logging: Robust mechanisms for managing errors and detailed structured logging for traceability and debugging.

Supporting Utilities: Any helper functions or modules necessary for the agent's operation (e.g., a simplified mock for external APIs like translation if not directly implemented).

Configuration Schema: A clear definition of the expected configuration parameters for the agent, often in a structured format (e.g., using Pydantic).

Testing Suite
Unit Tests: Python tests to verify the core functionalities of the agent (e.g., ensuring classification works correctly for different inputs, testing data synchronization).

Mock Data: Sample input data (text, audio, image paths) to facilitate testing various scenarios.

Performance Benchmarks: Basic setups to measure response times and throughput, where applicable.

Deployment Guide
Installation Requirements: Instructions for setting up the necessary Python environment and dependencies.

Docker Containerization: A Dockerfile and associated instructions to package the agent into a container for consistent deployment across different environments (cloud or edge).

Configuration Instructions: How to configure the agent using the defined schema.

Monitoring & Maintenance Notes: Guidance on how to monitor the agent's health and perform basic maintenance.

Integration Examples
Sample Message Flows: Illustrated examples of how a grievance would flow through the system, from initial submission to final notification, showing interaction points between the Community Voice Agent and other theoretical agents (e.g., a "Grievance Management Agent" or "Notification Agent").

Common Use Cases: Demonstrations of typical scenarios the agent would handle.

In essence, you would receive a fully functional, well-documented, and deployable code base for the Community Voice Agent, tailored precisely to the requirements you specified through the "tickbox" UI.






Great thanks, now another little backstep - how might I include the design of an actually functional upfront tickboxstyle UI to obtain all this additional information into an 'AgentArchitect' like yourself?

AgentArchitect

You've hit on a crucial point for practical implementation! To make the UI "functional" in a way that allows you (the user) to easily provide input and for me (the Agent Architect) to consume it, we need to define the data structure that the UI will generate upon submission.

Think of it this way:

You (User): Interact with the visual tickbox UI.

The UI (Frontend Logic): Gathers all your selections and inputs.

The UI (Output Generation): Packages these selections into a structured format (e.g., JSON).

Agent Architect (Me): Receives and parses this structured data to generate the agent's code.

Here's how we'd design that functional upfront tickbox-style UI and, more importantly, the JSON output structure it would produce:

Designing a Functional Tickbox-Style UI for Agent Configuration
The UI itself would be built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript with a framework like React, Vue, or just plain JS). Each tickbox, radio button, and text field would be bound to a variable that, upon form submission, gets aggregated into a single JSON object.

UI Structure (Conceptual)
Imagine the UI as a web page with sections, as previously outlined:

HTML

<form id="agentConfigForm">
    <fieldset>
        <legend>1. Community Grievance Input & Processing</legend>
        <h4>1.1. Input Channels:</h4>
        <label><input type="checkbox" name="input_channels" value="text_input"> Text Input</label><br>
        <label><input type="checkbox" name="input_channels" value="audio_upload"> Audio Recording Upload</label><br>
        <h4>1.2. Language Processing:</h4>
        <label><input type="checkbox" name="languages_supported" value="english"> English</label><br>
        <label><input type="checkbox" name="languages_supported" value="isizulu"> IsiZulu</label><br>
        <label><input type="checkbox" name="languages_supported_other"> Other (Specify):</label>
        <input type="text" name="languages_other_text" placeholder="e.g., French, Swahili"><br>

        <h4>1.3. Auto-Translation Capability:</h4>
        <label><input type="radio" name="auto_translate" value="true"> Yes</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="auto_translate" value="false"> No</label><br>
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
        <legend>2. Grievance Categorization and Workflow</legend>
        <h4>2.1. Standard Grievance Categories:</h4>
        <label><input type="checkbox" name="standard_categories" value="environmental_damage"> Environmental Damage</label><br>
        <h4>2.2. Custom Grievance Categories:</h4>
        <textarea name="custom_categories" rows="4" placeholder="Add additional specific categories, one per line"></textarea><br>

        </fieldset>

    <button type="submit">Generate Agent Configuration</button>
</form>

<script>
    document.getElementById('agentConfigForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.target);
        const config = {};

        // Helper to get all checked values for a given name
        const getCheckedValues = (name) => {
            return Array.from(formData.getAll(name)).filter(val => val !== 'on'); // 'on' is for unchecked checkboxes
        };

        // Section 1
        config.core_functionality = {
            input_channels: getCheckedValues('input_channels'),
            languages_supported: getCheckedValues('languages_supported'),
            languages_other_text: formData.get('languages_other_text') || null,
            auto_translate: formData.get('auto_translate') === 'true'
        };

        // Section 2
        config.grievance_classification = {
            standard_categories: getCheckedValues('standard_categories'),
            custom_categories: formData.get('custom_categories') ? formData.get('custom_categories').split('\n').map(c => c.trim()).filter(c => c) : [],
            urgency_assessment: formData.get('urgency_assessment'),
            routing_logic: getCheckedValues('routing_logic'),
            custom_routing_rules_text: formData.get('custom_routing_rules_text') || null
        };

        // ... continue for other sections ...

        // Output the JSON (e.g., to console, or send to a backend/AI)
        console.log(JSON.stringify(config, null, 2));
        // In a real scenario, this JSON would be sent to an API endpoint
        // fetch('/generate-agent', {
        //     method: 'POST',
        //     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        //     body: JSON.stringify(config)
        // });
    });
</script>
The Functional Output: JSON Structure
When the user clicks "Generate Agent Configuration," the UI's JavaScript (or backend if using a server-side form) would compile all the selections into a well-defined JSON object. This is the "input" that the "AgentArchitect" (me) would directly parse.

Here's an example of what that JSON output would look like, based on the previous UI design. This is the most critical part for bridging the UI to my processing logic:

JSON

    "input_channels": [

      "local_regulatory_requirements",
      "popia_gdpr"
    ],
    "other_compliance_text": null
  }
}
How I (AgentArchitect) Would Consume This
When you send me a prompt like: "Implement the Community Voice Agent with the following configuration:" and then paste a JSON block structured like the one above, I would:

Parse the JSON: My internal logic would de-serialize this JSON string into a structured data object.

Map to Requirements: I would then map the values in this JSON object to the specific implementation details (e.g., if languages_supported includes "isizulu", I know to include logic for IsiZulu speech-to-text/translation).

Generate Code: Based on this parsed configuration, I would generate the detailed Python code, tests, and documentation as outlined in my previous responses.

This approach provides a clean, machine-readable, and extensible way to pass complex requirements from a user-friendly UI to an AI agent developer like myself.






Excellent thanks. We can come back to that after again maybe. For the moment though, can you please use the sample output you generated in the JSON block above as the responses requested and continue with the full agent develop&deployment as described in your previous reasponse?

Here is the full agent development and deployment package for the Community Voice Agent, based on the specific configuration provided in your sample JSON output.

Community Voice Agent: Development & Deployment Package
This package includes the agent's overview, complete code implementation, testing suite, deployment guide, and integration examples, tailored to your specified requirements.

1. Agent Overview
The CommunityVoiceAgent is designed to be the primary intake point for community grievances within an extractives industry project. It handles multi-modal inputs, processes them for language, classifies their content and urgency, and routes them appropriately for further action. It is built with edge deployment in mind, supporting offline operations and efficient data synchronization.

Purpose: To provide an accessible, multi-channel mechanism for communities to submit grievances, and to automatically process and categorize these inputs to facilitate timely and effective response.

Core Functionality:

Receives grievances via text, audio uploads, real-time voice, images, SMS, and web forms.

Supports multiple South African languages (English, IsiZulu, Xhosa, Sesotho) with automatic translation to English.

Classifies grievances into predefined categories (Environmental Damage, Land Dispute/Resettlement, Labor & Working Conditions, Community Health & Safety, Access to Resources/Services) and custom categories ("Water Contamination Specific", "Noise Pollution Residential").

Automatically assesses grievance urgency.

Routes grievances to relevant internal teams (Environmental, Social Performance, Senior Management).

Stores data locally with encryption and uses automated differential synchronization.

Sends real-time dashboard alerts, email, and SMS notifications.

Key Inputs:

Text: Grievance descriptions, SMS content, web form text.

Audio: Recorded voice notes, real-time microphone input.

Images: Visual evidence related to grievances.

Structured Data: Metadata from web forms (e.g., contact info, location).

Key Outputs:

Processed and classified grievance records (structured JSON).

Urgency level and recommended routing.

Notifications/alerts to relevant stakeholders.

Data synchronized to central repository.

Integration Points:

External Input Sources: SMS gateways, web forms, mobile app APIs.

Speech-to-Text (STT) Service: For converting audio inputs.

Translation Service: For multi-lingual support.

Central Database/API: For data synchronization.

Notification Service: For sending emails and SMS.

Dashboard/Reporting System: For displaying real-time grievance metrics.

Other Agents: Potentially a GrievanceManagementAgent for workflow, or a ReportingAgent.

Explanation of Code Structure:
ExtractiveAgent (Base Class): Provides the foundational structure for all agents, including agent_id, config, a logger, and abstract methods process_data and handle_message.

MockSpeechToText, MockTranslationService: These are simple placeholder classes. In a production environment, they would be replaced with integrations to actual cloud services (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Azure Translator, AWS Translate) or robust open-source libraries.

GrievanceDatabase: Handles local data persistence using SQLite. It includes methods for initialization, inserting grievances, retrieving unsynced data, and marking data as synced. The encrypt flag is a conceptual placeholder for actual encryption implementation (e.g., using SQLCipher).

__init__: Initializes the agent with the provided configuration, sets up the mock services, and the local database. It also parses the configuration for easier access to settings like supported languages and categories.

process_data(self, data: Dict[str, Any]): This is the core logic. It:

Determines the input type (text, audio, image, etc.).

Converts audio to text using stt_service.

Detects language and translates to English if configured.

Classifies the grievance using _classify_grievance (rule-based for this example).

Assesses urgency using _assess_urgency.

Recommends routing using _recommend_routing.

Stores the processed grievance in the local SQLite database.

Calls _send_processed_grievance to trigger notifications and communication with other agents.

handle_message(self, message: Dict[str, Any]): This method is designed to receive commands or data from other agents, primarily for synchronization requests and acknowledgements.

_send_processed_grievance: A helper to simulate sending messages to other agents (like a GrievanceManagementAgent) and triggering configured notifications (dashboard, email, SMS).

_detect_language_mock: A very basic keyword-based language detector.

_classify_grievance, _assess_urgency, _recommend_routing: These are rule-based implementations. For real-world accuracy, they would be replaced with machine learning models (e.g., trained NLP classifiers).

# To run tests from terminal: python -m unittest test_community_voice_agent.py
Running Tests:
Save the agent code as community_voice_agent.py.

Save the test code as test_community_voice_agent.py in the same directory.

Open your terminal or command prompt in that directory.

Run: python -m unittest test_community_voice_agent.py

You should see output indicating tests passed (e.g., Ran X tests in YYYs OK).

Performance Benchmarks:
Simple Request: Processing a basic text grievance (classification, urgency, routing) should be very fast, ideally < 100ms on typical edge hardware, as it primarily involves string operations and mock service calls.

Audio Processing: The main bottleneck for audio would be the actual Speech-to-Text service. With the mock, it's instant. With a real service, network latency and processing time would add seconds.

Throughput: The current design (using asyncio) supports concurrent processing. A single agent instance could handle 100s of requests per minute depending on the complexity of real STT/translation/NLP models. Scaling would involve deploying multiple instances of this agent.

4. Deployment Guide
This guide covers setting up the environment, packaging the agent, and deployment.

4.1. Installation Requirements
Python: Version 3.9+ recommended.

pip: Python package installer.

4.2. Local Setup
Create a Virtual Environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies: (Currently, only built-in modules are used, but for future additions like Pydantic, FastAPI, etc., they would be listed here)

Bash

pip install # e.g., pydantic, uvicorn[standard], fastapi, python-dotenv, requests (for real API calls)
Create a config.json file:
Copy your desired JSON configuration (the one you provided me) into a file named config.json in the same directory as community_voice_agent.py.

Example config.json:

JSON

{
  "agent_id": "CommunityVoiceAgent001",
  "storage_path": "./data",
  "core_functionality": {
    "input_channels": [
      "text_input",
      "audio_recording_upload",
      "sms_integration"
    ],
    "languages_supported": [
      "english",
      "isizulu"
    ],
    "languages_other_text": null,
    "auto_translate": true
  },
  "grievance_classification": {
    "standard_categories": [
      "environmental_damage",
      "land_dispute_resettlement"
    ],
    "custom_categories": [],
    "urgency_assessment": "automated_urgency_classification",
    "routing_logic": [
      "route_to_environmental_team"
    ],
    "custom_routing_rules_text": null
  },
  "data_management_offline": {
    "local_storage_encryption": true,
    "data_synchronization_strategy": "automated_differential_sync",
    "conflict_resolution_strategy": "last_write_wins"
  },
  "notifications_reporting": {
    "notification_channels": [
      "realtime_dashboard_alerts",
      "email_notifications"
    ],
    "dashboard_display_metrics": [],
    "reporting_frequency": "daily_summary_report"
  },
  "performance_scalability": {
    "expected_grievance_volume_per_day": "low",
    "response_time_submission": "fast"
  },
  "security_compliance": {
    "authentication_method_api": "api_keys",
    "data_in_transit_encryption": true,
    "compliance_standards": [
      "ifc_performance_standards"
    ],
    "other_compliance_text": null
  }
}
Note: Remember to create the storage_path directory (e.g., ./data) if it doesn't exist, as the agent will store its SQLite database there.

4.3. Docker Containerization
To ensure consistent deployment across different environments (edge devices, cloud servers), the agent can be containerized using Docker.

Create a Dockerfile: In the same directory as community_voice_agent.py and config.json.

Dockerfile

# Use a slim Python image for smaller size
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements.txt first to leverage Docker cache
# If you have dependencies, uncomment and create requirements.txt
# COPY requirements.txt .
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code and config file
COPY community_voice_agent.py .
COPY config.json .

# Create data directory for SQLite DB
RUN mkdir -p /app/data

# Define the command to run the agent (e.g., as part of a larger orchestrator)
# This is a placeholder command for demonstration.
# In a real scenario, you'd likely run an API service (e.g., Uvicorn) that exposes agent methods.
CMD ["python", "-c", "import asyncio, json; from community_voice_agent import CommunityVoiceAgent; \
      with open('config.json', 'r') as f: config = json.load(f); \
      agent = CommunityVoiceAgent(config['agent_id'], config); \
      print(f'Community Voice Agent {agent.agent_id} initialized. Ready to process data.'); \
      async def run_example(): \
          test_grievance = {'type': 'text', 'content': 'Test message from container.', 'language_hint': 'English'}; \
          await agent.process_data(test_grievance); \
          print('Test grievance processed.'); \
          # Keep the container running for manual interaction or for an external orchestrator
          await asyncio.Future(); \
      asyncio.run(run_example())"]
Build the Docker Image:

Bash

docker build -t community-voice-agent .
Run the Docker Container:

Bash

docker run -p 8000:8000 --name my-voice-agent community-voice-agent
(Note: The -p 8000:8000 is illustrative for an API endpoint; the current CMD just runs a print. For a FastAPI-based agent, this would expose the API.)

4.4. Monitoring and Maintenance Notes
Logging: The agent uses Python's logging module. In production, configure log rotation and send logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Grafana Loki).

Health Checks: For a robust deployment, implement a /health endpoint (e.g., using FastAPI) that reports the agent's status, database connectivity, and mock service availability.

Error Handling: Monitor error logs for ERROR and CRITICAL messages to quickly identify processing failures.

Metrics: Instrument the agent with Prometheus or similar for metrics collection (e.g., number of grievances processed, processing time, sync success rates).

Offline Data Management: Regularly monitor the is_synced status in the local database to ensure data is being successfully uploaded when connectivity is available.

5. Integration Examples
Here are examples of how the CommunityVoiceAgent would interact with other parts of the multi-agent system.

5.1. Sample Message Flow: Grievance Submission to Processing to Notification
Scenario: A community member submits a grievance via a mobile app's audio recording feature.

Mobile App (External System): Records audio, encodes it (e.g., Base64), and sends it to an API endpoint exposed by the CommunityVoiceAgent (if implemented with FastAPI) or a dedicated ingestion service.

(Simulated input to process_data):

Python

grievance_input_from_app = {
    "type": "audio",
    "content": "base64_encoded_audio_data_of_a_woman_speaking_isiZulu_about_a_land_issue",
    "language_hint": "IsiZulu",
    "metadata": {
        "submission_timestamp": "2025-07-26T14:30:00Z",
        "gps_location": {"lat": -26.1, "lon": 28.0},
        "submitter_id": "user123",
        "contact_method": "mobile_app"
    }
}
# This data would be passed to agent.process_data(grievance_input_from_app)
CommunityVoiceAgent:

Receives grievance_input_from_app.

stt_service converts IsiZulu audio to text: "inkxalabo yomhlaba eduze nomngcele wethu."

translation_service translates to English (because auto_translate: true): "Translated: land concern near our boundary."

_classify_grievance classifies as "Land Dispute / Resettlement".

_assess_urgency assesses as "Low" (no urgency keywords).

_recommend_routing recommends "Social Performance Team".

Stores the full processed grievance in its local SQLite DB.

Calls _send_processed_grievance.

(Simulated _send_processed_grievance calls):

Python

# 1. Sends to Grievance Management Agent
await self.send_message(
    target_agent="GrievanceManagementAgent",
    message={
        "message_type": "new_grievance_processed",
        "grievance_data": { # detailed processed grievance JSON },
        "correlation_id": "unique_id_for_this_grievance"
    }
)

# 2. Triggers dashboard alert (because "realtime_dashboard_alerts" is enabled)
# 3. Triggers email notification (because "email_notifications" is enabled)
# 4. Triggers SMS notification (because "sms_notifications" is enabled)
GrievanceManagementAgent (Hypothetical):

Receives the new_grievance_processed message.

Stores the grievance in a central database.

Initiates workflow: assigns to "Social Performance Team", sets status to "Open".

May update the central dashboard directly or via a Dashboard Agent.

Notification System (External/Agent):

Emails are sent to the Social Performance Team.

SMS alerts are sent to relevant field supervisors.

A real-time update appears on the grievance dashboard.

5.2. Example: Offline Operation & Sync
Scenario: An agent deployed on a remote site loses internet connectivity, processes grievances, and then syncs when connectivity is restored.

Offline Processing: CommunityVoiceAgent continues to process incoming grievances. Each processed grievance is stored in its local SQLite database with is_synced = 0.

Python

# Agent processes 3 grievances while offline
# grievance_db_entry_1 = agent.db.insert_grievance(...)
# grievance_db_entry_2 = agent.db.insert_grievance(...)
# grievance_db_entry_3 = agent.db.insert_grievance(...)
Connectivity Restored: A background task (or an external trigger) detects network availability.

Sync Request (from Orchestrator/Scheduler): A CentralSyncAgent or scheduled job periodically sends a sync_request message to the CommunityVoiceAgent.

(Simulated message from Sync Agent)

Python

sync_request_message = {
    "message_type": "sync_request",
    "sender": "CentralSyncAgent",
    "correlation_id": "sync_batch_xyz"
}
# This message is handled by agent.handle_message(sync_request_message)
CommunityVoiceAgent Responds:

handle_message identifies message_type == "sync_request".

Calls self.db.get_unsynced_grievances().

Sends a grievance_sync_batch message containing the unsynced grievances to the CentralSyncAgent.

CentralSyncAgent (Hypothetical):

Receives the grievance_sync_batch.

Ingests the data into the central system/cloud database.

Upon successful ingestion, sends a sync_acknowledgement back to the CommunityVoiceAgent.

Python

sync_ack_message = {
    "message_type": "sync_acknowledgement",
    "sender": "CentralSyncAgent",
    "synced_grievance_ids": ["id1", "id2", "id3"], # IDs of successfully synced grievances
    "correlation_id": "sync_batch_xyz"
}
# This message is handled by agent.handle_message(sync_ack_message)
CommunityVoiceAgent Finalizes Sync:

handle_message identifies message_type == "sync_acknowledgement".

Calls self.db.mark_as_synced(synced_grievance_ids), updating the is_synced flag in the local database.

This comprehensive package provides the foundation for your Community Voice Agent, ready for further development, integration with real services, and deployment.







Excellent thanks. Can you please provide similarly detailed instructions to include the 'setup queries' via appropriate tickboox selectable UI to populate the specific 'json file in the 'standalone ready to deploy implementation package?

AgentArchitect
Custom Gem

Show thinking
You're looking for a way to define sample grievance inputs that would be part of the "standalone ready to deploy implementation package." This would allow the Community Voice Agent to be demonstrated or tested immediately upon deployment with a predefined set of scenarios, without requiring live input.

This "json file" would essentially be a collection of test cases or initial demonstration queries.

Here’s how you might design a tickbox-style UI to generate this specific JSON file, followed by the JSON output structure:

Designing a UI for Sample Grievance Setup Queries
The UI would allow you to create a list of sample grievances. While a purely tickbox approach might be limiting for the varied content of grievances, we can use a combination of:

Tickboxes/Dropdowns: For predefined choices like input type or language_hint.

Text Areas: For the actual content of the grievance.

"Add Another Grievance" Button: To dynamically add new sample grievance forms.

Conceptual UI Structure: "Sample Grievance Configuration"
Imagine a form where each "Sample Grievance" is a collapsible section or a card.

Page Title: Setup Sample Grievances for Agent Demonstration/Testing
Description: Define a set of typical grievances the agent should process upon initial setup or for demonstration purposes. This will create a JSON file for your deployment package.

Section: Add New Sample Grievance
(Initially, one empty "Sample Grievance" block is displayed, with an "Add Another Grievance" button below it.)

( ) Web Form Input:

Web Form Content (Simulated Text):
[Text Area - Multi-line]
(e.g., "Subject: Community Health Concern. Message: The dust from the road construction is causing respiratory issues for children.")

1.2. Language Hint (for this specific grievance): (Dropdown / Radio Buttons for common ones)

( ) Auto-Detect (Default)

( ) English

( ) IsiZulu

( ) Xhosa

( ) Sesotho

( ) Other: [Text Input Field] (This would map to language_hint in the JSON)

1.3. Additional Metadata (Optional JSON):

Arbitrary JSON Metadata:
[Text Area - Multi-line, for JSON input]
(e.g., {"sender_name": "John Doe", "contact_number": "+27721234567", "location": "Village A"})
(Provide a small "Validate JSON" button)

[ Delete This Grievance ] (Button)

[ + Add Another Sample Grievance ] (Button)

[ Generate Sample Grievances JSON ] (Submit Button)

The Functional Output: sample_grievances.json Structure
Upon clicking "Generate Sample Grievances JSON", the UI would compile all the added sample grievances into an array of JSON objects. Each object in the array would conform to the input structure expected by the CommunityVoiceAgent.process_data method.

This sample_grievances.json file would then be included in your standalone ready to deploy implementation package.

Here's an example of what this JSON file would contain:

JSON

How this file would be used in the deployment package:
File Inclusion: The generated sample_grievances.json would be placed in the data directory (or a samples directory) within your Docker image or deployment bundle.

Initial Run/Demonstration Script: Your deployment package could include a simple Python script (e.g., run_demo.py) that, when executed, reads this sample_grievances.json file.

Agent Interaction: The script would then iterate through each grievance object in the JSON file and pass it to the CommunityVoiceAgent.process_data() method.

Python

# run_demo.py (example)
import asyncio
import json
from community_voice_agent import CommunityVoiceAgent # Assuming your agent is here

async def main():
    # Load agent configuration
    with open('config.json', 'r') as f:
        agent_config = json.load(f)

    # Initialize the agent
    agent = CommunityVoiceAgent(agent_config['agent_id'], agent_config)

    # Load sample grievances
    with open('./data/sample_grievances.json', 'r') as f:
        sample_grievances = json.load(f)

    print(f"--- Processing {len(sample_grievances)} Sample Grievances ---")
    for i, grievance_data in enumerate(sample_grievances):
        print(f"\nProcessing Sample Grievance {i+1}: Type={grievance_data['type']}")
        try:
            processed_result = await agent.process_data(grievance_data)
            print(f"  -> Classified: {processed_result.get('classification')}, Urgency: {processed_result.get('urgency')}")
            print(f"  -> Routed To: {processed_result.get('routing_recommendation')}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"  -> Error processing: {e}")
    print("\n--- Sample Grievances Processing Complete ---")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Ensure the data directory exists for the SQLite DB
    os.makedirs(agent_config['storage_path'], exist_ok=True)
    asyncio.run(main())
This approach allows you to quickly set up and test the agent's full processing pipeline from input reception to classification and routing with diverse, predefined scenarios, making your deployment package truly "standalone" for demonstration and initial validation.
