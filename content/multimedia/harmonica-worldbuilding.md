# World of Harmonica: Complete Reference

## Magical System

### Core Mechanics
- Everything in the universe vibrates at certain frequencies
- Mages learn to sense these vibrations and alter them through various means
- Magic is performed by creating harmonies or dissonance with these natural frequencies

### Magic Types
- **Harmonic Magic**: Working with existing frequencies to enhance or stabilize
- **Dissonant Magic**: Disrupting frequencies for destructive effects
- **Chord Magic**: Combining multiple frequencies for complex effects
- **Resonant Magic**: Amplifying natural frequencies to extreme levels

### Learning System
- Apprentices first learn to "hear" the frequencies around them
- Progress through learning simple "notes" to complex "symphonies"
- Different schools might focus on different "instruments" or methods

### Limitations
- Creating dissonance could have dangerous backlash
- Complex spells require precise timing and control
- Magical exhaustion comes from maintaining frequencies too long
- Some materials or beings naturally resist frequency manipulation

### Celestial Harmonies
- Each celestial body resonates with a specific fundamental frequency
- These frequencies create the grand "Cosmic Symphony"
- Different types of magic become more powerful when in harmony with dominant celestial frequencies
- Astronomical events create unique harmonic opportunities

### The Five Sacred Sounds (Panch Shabd)
- The Thunder Sound (First Region)
- The Sound of Rolling Oceans (Second Region)
- The Sound of Strings (Third Region)
- The Sound of Flutes (Fourth Region)
- The Sound of Bells/Gongs (Fifth Region)

### Inner Listening (Surat Shabd Yoga adaptation)
- Mages must first learn to listen inward through deep meditation
- Progressive awakening to subtler and higher frequency realms
- Development of "inner ear" before attempting external manipulation
- Spiritual purity affecting magical capability
